Descriptive statistics models in Python 3

  Sampling consists of the process of selecting and choosing elements of a population to form a sample.
  In scientific research, in which it is desired to know some characteristics of a population, it is also very common to observe only a sample of its elements and, from the results of that sample, obtain approximate values, or estimates, for the population characteristics of interest.
This type of survey is usually called a Sample Survey.

  Proportional stratified sampling: in this specific case, the proportionality of the size of each stratum of the population is maintained in the sample, that is, if the estimator is 20%, for example, each stratum will have a representation of 20% of its size in the sample. Proportional stratified sampling ensures that each member of the population is equally likely to belong to the sample.
